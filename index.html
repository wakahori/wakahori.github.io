        <p>
        My team created an affinity diagram for time management solutions. <br/>
        Each member used a different color note.

      <p>
        My persona for my team is Jimmy Smith. He is a full time student at a university who is pursuing a Computer Science degree. <br/>
        He is trying to finish his degree a semester early, and is taking 6 classes a semester, giving him a lot of work to do every week. <br/>
        For me, I had to use a different site for the persona because the one given wasn't working correctly.
